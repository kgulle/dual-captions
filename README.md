## dual-captions <br/> YouTube add-on to show captions in 2 languages ðŸ’¬


### Intro

As someone learning a foreign language, it is helpful for me to see both what the speaker is saying and the translation. 

As of January 2018, YouTube can only show captions in one language. 

This Chrome Extension creates a MutationObserver which waits for new caption elements to be added to the DOM. It then translates the text of these captions and adds the translated captions underneath.

### Roadmap

Open issues:

- The translation can come back too late and the caption has already been removed from the DOM. 

### Usage

Link to Google Chrome Store: *Coming soon*

You can load the extension manually by enabling Developer Mode in chrome://extensions. See https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked.
